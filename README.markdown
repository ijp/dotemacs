# Dot Emacs
My Dot Emacs originally started off as technomancy's starter kit a
few years back. But as any good Emacs user knows, starter kits just
end up causing you trouble.

Over time I've ripped bits out and replaced others, but you can still
tell that's what it was. Over time, I'm trying to flush out the last
bits of utility I got from it.
